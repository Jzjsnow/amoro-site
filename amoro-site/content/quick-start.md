# Quickstart

This guide outlines the basic process of using Amoro, allowing you to quickly experience its core features. You can choose to use either the `Iceberg Format` or the `Mixed-Iceberg Format` to complete the entire process. 

If you are more interested in the `Mixed-Hive Format` or the `Paimon Format`, you can refer to: [Mixed-Hive Format](/docs/latest/mixed-hive-format/) and [Paimon Format](/docs/latest/paimon-format/). For specific information on the different formats supported by Amoro, please refer to: [Table Format](/docs/latest/formats-overview/).

Before starting the quick demo, some steps are required to prepare the environment. The fastest way to get started is to use a docker-compose file that uses the apache/amoro image. To use this, you'll need to install the [Docker CLI](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) as well as the [Docker Compose CLI](https://github.com/docker/compose-cli/blob/main/INSTALL.md).

Once you have those, save the yaml below into a file named docker-compose.yml:
```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  minio:
    image: minio/minio
    container_name: minio
    environment:
      - MINIO_ROOT_USER=admin
      - MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=password
      - MINIO_DOMAIN=minio
    networks:
      amoro_network:
        aliases:
          - warehouse.minio
    ports:
      - 9001:9001
      - 9000:9000
    command: [ "server", "/data", "--console-address", ":9001" ]
  mc:
    depends_on:
      - minio
    image: minio/mc
    container_name: mc
    networks:
      amoro_network:
    environment:
      - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=admin
      - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=password
      - AWS_REGION=us-east-1
    entrypoint: >
      /bin/sh -c "
      until (/usr/bin/mc config host add minio http://minio:9000 admin password) do echo '...waiting...' && sleep 1; done;
      /usr/bin/mc rm -r --force minio/warehouse;
      /usr/bin/mc mb minio/warehouse;
      /usr/bin/mc policy set public minio/warehouse;
      tail -f /dev/null
      "
  amoro:
    image: apache/amoro
    container_name: amoro
    ports:
      - 8081:8081
      - 1630:1630
      - 1260:1260
    environment:
      - JVM_XMS=1024
    networks:
      amoro_network:
    volumes:
      - ./amoro:/tmp/warehouse
    command: ["/entrypoint.sh", "ams"]
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true

networks:
  amoro_network:
    driver: bridge
```
Next, start up the docker containers with this command:
```shell
docker-compose up
```

## Prepare steps

### Create optimizer group

Open [http://localhost:1630](http://localhost:1630) in a browser, enter `admin/admin` to log in to the dashboard.

Click on `Optimizing` in the sidebar, choose `Optimizer Groups` and click `Add Group` button to create a new group befre creating catalog:

![Create group](../images/quickstart/create-group.png)

### Create catalog

Click on `Catalogs` in the sidebar, click on the `+` button under Catalog List to create a test catalog, and name it to `demo_catalog`:
{{% codetabs "CreateCatalog" %}}
{{% addtab "Iceberg Format" "spark-queries" "spark-sql" %}}
{{% addtab "Mixed-Iceberg Format" "spark-queries" "spark-shell" %}}
{{% tabcontent "spark-sql"  %}}

To use the Iceberg Format, select `Type` as `Internal Catalog`, and choose `Iceberg` as `Table Format`.
![Create iceberg catalog](../images/quickstart/create-iceberg-catalog.png)

{{% /tabcontent %}}
{{% tabcontent "spark-shell" %}}

To use the Mixed-Iceberg Format, select `Type` as `Internal Catalog`, and choose `Mixed-Iceberg` as `Table Format`.
![Create mixed catalog](../images/quickstart/create-mixed-catalog.png)

{{% /tabcontent %}}
{{% /codetabs %}}


### Start optimizers

Click on `Optimizing` in the sidebar, select the `Optimizers` tab, and click the `Create Optimizer` button.

![Scale out optimizer](../images/quickstart/create-optimizer.png)

Choose the `local` resource group and set the concurrency of the optimizer to 1 and click `OK`.

You may need to wait a few seconds and try refreshing the page, you will find the newly launched optimizer here.

![Optimizers](../images/quickstart/optimizers.png)

{{< hint info >}}
You may need to wait for up to 30 seconds for the optimizer to register with AMS.
{{< /hint >}}

## Demo steps

### Initialize tables

Click on `Terminal` in the sidebar, you can create the test tables here using SQL. Terminal supports executing Spark SQL statements for now.

{{% codetabs "CreateATable" %}}
{{% addtab "Iceberg Format" "spark-queries" "spark-sql" %}}
{{% addtab "Mixed-Iceberg Format" "spark-queries" "spark-shell" %}}
{{% tabcontent "spark-sql"  %}}
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS db.user (
    id INT,
    name string,
    ts TIMESTAMP
) USING iceberg 
PARTITIONED BY (days(ts));

INSERT OVERWRITE db.user VALUES 
(1, "eric", timestamp("2022-07-01 12:32:00")),
(2, "frank", timestamp("2022-07-02 09:11:00")),
(3, "lee", timestamp("2022-07-02 10:11:00"));

SELECT * FROM db.user;
```
{{% /tabcontent %}}
{{% tabcontent "spark-shell" %}}
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS db;
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS db.user (
    id INT,
    name string,
    ts TIMESTAMP,
    PRIMARY KEY(id)
) USING mixed_iceberg 
PARTITIONED BY (days(ts));

INSERT OVERWRITE db.user VALUES 
(1, "eric", timestamp("2022-07-01 12:32:00")),
(2, "frank", timestamp("2022-07-02 09:11:00")),
(3, "lee", timestamp("2022-07-02 10:11:00"));

SELECT * FROM db.user;
```
{{% /tabcontent %}}
{{% /codetabs %}}

Click on the `RUN` button uppon the SQL editor, and wait for the SQL query to finish executing. You can then see the query results under the SQL editor.

### Make some changes

Execute the following SQL statements one by one in the `Terminal`:

```sql
-- insert a few rows first
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (4, 'rock',  CAST('2022-07-02 01:11:20' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (5, 'jack',  CAST('2022-07-02 05:22:10' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (6, 'mars',  CAST('2022-07-02 08:23:20' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (7, 'cloe',  CAST('2022-07-02 08:44:50' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (8, 'smith', CAST('2022-07-02 10:52:20' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (9, 'piec',  CAST('2022-07-02 11:24:30' AS TIMESTAMP));
INSERT INTO db.user (id, name, ts) VALUES (10, 'vovo', CAST('2022-07-02 12:00:20' AS TIMESTAMP));


-- delete some rows then
DELETE FROM db.user where id = 1;
DELETE FROM db.user where id = 4;
DELETE FROM db.user where id = 7;


-- query the table 
SELECT * from db.user;
```

### Check self-optimizing

As new data is written to the table, Amoro will automatically trigger self-optimizing on the table.

Click on `Tables` in the sidebar, select the test table to enter the table details page, and switch to the `Optimizing` tab, where you can see all the self-optimizing tasks on the table.

![Table optimizing history](../images/quickstart/table-optimizing-history.png)

You can also enter the `Optimizing` page through the sidebar to view the current optimizing status of all tables.

![Table optimizing status](../images/quickstart/table-optimizing-status.png)

For more information on Self-Optimizing, please refer to: [Self-optimizing](/docs/latest/self-optimizing/)

{{< hint info >}}
After finishing the demo, you can run the following command in the directory of docker-compose.yml to stop all containers:
{{< /hint >}}
```shell
docker-compose down
```
